運動好處多
對不運動的人來說, 剛開始運動或許會覺得很辛苦, 不過, 要是怕意每天
跑步、打球, 就會發現經常運動有很多好處。比如說, 讓我們體力好、有精
神、比較不容易生病。要是能跟家人或是朋友一起運動的話, 不但身體會越來
越健康, 也會讓大家的關係更好呢!
其實, 運動對學習也有很大的幫助。在台灣, 很多學生很用功, 總是念書
念到半夜才去睡覺, 所以白天上課就沒有精神, 容易打購睡。 學校為了改善這
個情況, 除了讓學生睡午覺, 每個星期也都會有一、兩堂体育課, 學生去操場
跑跑步、打打球, 運動一下再繼續念書, 一定比一直坐在教室里好。
醫生也常建議病人多運動, 因為運動能幫助他們恢复身體和心理的健康。
如果你覺得心情不好, 就出門去散散步、廓游泳, 或是在家里做做家事, 活動
一下。這樣, 也許就能把難過的事情忘了。
運動有這麼多的好處, 讓我們脫下牛仔褲、穿上運動服, 一起去運動吧!
