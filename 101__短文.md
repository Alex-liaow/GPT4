The Greatest Teacherof China 一Confucius
Some people say that whether Chinese or foreigners, 1f they want to Study
Chinese philosophy, they must know Confucius first because he is the greatest
teacher in China. In Taiwan, the Teacher's Day on September 28th is the holiday to
commemorate him.
Confucius had taken his Students to many different countries, so that everyone
could understand his political ideals. It was tough, but that was his choice, because
了roughout his life, he always hoped there would be a king who could take his
advice and rule the country With his methods. Nobody had expected that after 13
years, and he had also been waiting for 13 years, none of the kings believyed him
and understood his thoughts. At ]ast, Confucius had no choice but to return to his
own country. At that time, he was already 68 years old.
The thoughts in ancient China were very conservative. The rich and people with
aprivileged backeround could go to school while ordinary people were not allowed
to. But for Confucius, no matter how old or young, stupid or clever rich or poob
as long as they want to learn, he is willing to teach them, so that everyone has the
opportunity to study and learn. Confucius also believes that we have to first identify
Students” personalities, performances and levels, and so on, and then use different
methods to teach them the truth ofconducting oneselfand doing things. In this way,
students can learn well and leam quickly.
Confucius successfully educated many students with his educational methods.
His political and philosophical thoughts not only affected the history and culture
of China, but also affected countries Such as Japan, South Korea, Vietnam, etc. So
from the past to the present, everyone thinks that Confucius is the greatest teacher
ofChina.
